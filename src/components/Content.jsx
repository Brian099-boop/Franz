            Re-homing dogs is one of the most crucial aspects of our work. Not only does it give one of our rescue dogs a new life in a loving home, but at the same time, it makes room at the Centre for another dog that needs our help.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Our aim is to always re-home dogs within the Philippines. If you think you can provide a happy, healthy, and safe home in the Philippines for one of our rescue dogs, please <a href="/contact" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700 transition duration-300">Contact Us about Adoption</a>.

            IWCTâ€™s rescue policy means that the individual who alerts us to a dog in need of rescuing must take responsibility for it once it is well enough to leave our care. That means they either adopt the dog themselves or find it a suitable home among family or friends.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            This means we have fewer dogs remaining at the Centre for prolonged periods of time and can therefore accommodate more dogs in need.

                Milly was found by Doc Roland, hungry and weak with a gaping wound on her head back in May 2023. She is now happy and healthy, she looks older for her age due to the severity of her parasitic infection. However, she is just as friendly and playful as any other dog. Her best friend is Divi, it would be wonderful if they could be adopted together.

                Divi was found by street dog feeder Jeff outside a DiviMart. She was weak, riddled with worms, and bald from mange. Now she is a happy, healthy, and playful little dog. Her best friend is Milly, and it would be lovely if they could be adopted together.

                Cooper was rescued by Suzanne when homeless Josie alerted her to him. He was chained up on a construction site for long periods of time without food or water. The site owner relinquished ownership to us. Cooper has begun rehabilitation in the Enrichment Park and is bouncy and excitable like Cheksa was. He will need an experienced home who can allow him to regularly exercise on a lead or run in enclosed, secure dog parks.
